The main program and some primitives for boolean functions are all in file
Equivalence.py


* Vector functions *
Functions are reprensented as column matrices with entries in a multivariate
polynomial ring:

R = PolynomialRing(GF(2), 'x', n)

You can generate such functions at random using
random_vector_function(m, n, degree).


* Extended affin equivalence *
One can construct Extended affine equivalent functions using method
EAE_function(F, A, a, B, b, C):


* Decide equivalence *
The algorithm for deciding and searching equivalence
is implemented in the function:

get_equivalence(F, G, limit = 10, s = None, verbose = False):

Encouraged parameters :
limit = 10, s = 3, verbose = True.


* Run a test *

load("test_equivalence.py")

You can modify its contents to perform other tests.
